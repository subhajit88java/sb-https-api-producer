loadTrustMaterial(cert, trust-strategy) >
TrustStrategy is having isTrusted(), overriding that method we can write our own trust logic.
if isTrusted() returns true , only  getAcceptedIssuers() of X509TrustManagerImpl gets called
if isTrusted() returns false, checkServerTrusted()[calls checkTrusted with last param i.e checkClientTrusted as false  and getAcceptedIssuers() of X509TrustManagerImpl gets called
if isTrusted() throws exception, will never land into X509TrustManagerImpl
